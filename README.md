This project explores the use of deep learning for threat detection, a crucial area in today's security landscape.

# Potential Applications:

> -> Physical security: 
>
>> The Project mentions "How to defend agaist a knife.gif", suggesting a potential focus on real-time threat detection in physical environments. This could involve video survelence, anomaly detection in sensor data, or even robotic response system.

> -> Technical Aspects:
>
>> -> Project employs various deep learning techniques, including convolution neural networks (CNNs) as evidence by the "FRCNN" folder. CNNs excel at recognizing patterns in images and videos making them well suited for threat detection tasks. 

>> -> Data pre-processing and augementation are crucial steps in traing robust deep learning models. The presence of files like data_preparationg and data_agumentation.
